### Twenty One Game
A simple console based application using basic class structure and inheritance. The game allows for one player to compete against the dealer in a game of blackjack. Also utilizes a logging feature that prints player information to a .txt file for review if necessary.
### Car Insurance
This project is an MVC web app that mimics a car insurance website. It takes the user's input on policy information and calculates a quote based on business logic. There is also an admin page that allows staff to view all of the quotes that have been issued.
